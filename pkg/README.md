# RISC Zero Verifier WASM

This project demonstrates how to verify RISC Zero receipts in a web browser using WebAssembly (WASM).

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo: Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can find installation instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- `wasm-pack`: This tool is used to build Rust-generated WebAssembly that you can run in the browser.
- Python 3: Used to serve the static files locally.

## Setup and Running

1.  **Install `wasm-pack`**:
    If you don't have `wasm-pack` installed, open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```

2.  **Build the WebAssembly Package**:
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    wasm-pack build --target web
    ```
    This command compiles your Rust code to WebAssembly and creates a `pkg` directory containing the necessary JavaScript and WASM files.

3.  **Serve the Static Files**:
    To view the `index.html` page, you need a simple HTTP server. You can use Python's built-in HTTP server.

    *   **Check if Python 3 is installed**:
        Open your terminal and type:
        ```bash
        python3 --version
        ```
        If it shows a version number (e.g., Python 3.x.x), you are good to go.

    *   **Install Python 3 (if not installed)**:
        -   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
            ```bash
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install python3
            ```
        -   **Linux (Fedora)**:
            ```bash
            sudo dnf install python3
            ```
        -   **macOS**: Python 3 is usually pre-installed. If not, you can install it using Homebrew:
            ```bash
            brew install python
            ```
        -   **Windows**: Download the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

    *   **Run the HTTP server**:
        In the project's root directory, run:
        ```bash
        python3 -m http.server
        ```
        If you only have `python` (and it points to Python 3), you might use:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```

4.  **View the Page**:
    Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:8000/static/](http://localhost:8000/static/)

    You should see the RISC Zero Receipt Verifier page where you can upload a receipt and an ELF/image file to verify.

## Project Structure

-   `src/lib.rs`: Contains the Rust code that will be compiled to WASM. This is where the receipt verification logic resides.
-   `static/index.html`: The main HTML page that interacts with the WASM module.
-   `pkg/`: This directory is generated by `wasm-pack` and contains the WASM binary and JavaScript bindings.
-   `Cargo.toml`: The Rust project's manifest file, defining dependencies and metadata.
